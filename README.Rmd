# What is tidycharts?

We all love the tidyverse and it's package due to its ease of use but I like most of us have struggled with building an interactive plot, I always turn to plotly documentation so much so that almost half of the plotly website links are dark blue for me. It's frustrating when something simple is very easy to forget. This could potentially go away if we had some sort of function that feels like using tidyverse so I've created few graphs that I create often. Tidycharts is basically a wrapper package for plotly with tidy syntax!

# Scatter plots

Pretty scatter plots are one of the most plotted graph ever (no data to prove my hypothesis, just a hunch!). So I've decided to start with scatter plots and work my way up to more complex charts.

# Bar charts

Another effective chart for data visualization is the bar chart. I've always wanted a single function to plot bar chart, horizontal bar chart, grouped bar chart and stacked bar chart. The tidychart's bar_chart() can do all of those!
