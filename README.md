# What is tidycharts?

We all love the tidyverse and it’s package due to its ease of use but I
like most of us have struggled with building an interactive plot, I
always turn to plotly documentation so much so that almost half of the
plotly website links are dark blue for me. It’s frustrating when
something simple is very easy to forget. This could potentially go away
if we had some sort of function that feels like using tidyverse so I’ve
created few graphs that I create often. Tidycharts is basically a
wrapper package for plotly with tidy syntax\!

# Scatter plots

Pretty scatter plots are one of the most plotted graph ever (no data to
prove my hypothesis, just a hunch\!). So I’ve decided to start with
scatter plots and work my way up to more complex charts.
